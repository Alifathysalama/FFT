# FFT

This project involves implementing a Radix-2 Decimation-in-Time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm in Verilog. The goal is to efficiently compute the FFT of a complex input signal. The project consists of several stages, each involving butterfly operations, where complex values are combined and separated to transform the input data from the time domain to the frequency domain. 

The provided Verilog code represents the first stage of the FFT process. In this stage, a set of butterfly operations is performed on a real-valued input sequence. The operations are carried out in a manner that produces the desired output. Specifically, the indices of the input sequence are combined and separated as specified in your provided loop.

The project appears to involve memory access, data manipulation, and control logic to manage the stages of the FFT computation. The goal is to achieve an efficient and accurate computation of the FFT for a given input signal.

As the project progresses, additional stages of the FFT algorithm will be implemented, each building upon the results of the previous stages. This is a complex and mathematically intensive project that requires a deep understanding of signal processing, digital logic design, and Verilog programming.

Please note that the provided code and descriptions are based on the interactions we've had so far. If there are additional details or context that you'd like to provide, I'd be happy to assist further.
